##  **Brief Report (API + challenges)**

```markdown
## Brief Report for AF-Country-APP

###  Chosen API

I used the **REST Countries API (v3)** to retrieve country-related data including name, population, region, subregion, languages, currencies, and flags.

API endpoint:

GET /all – to get a list of all countries.
GET /name/{name} – to search a country by its name.
GET /region/{region} – to get countries from a specific region.
GET /alpha/{code} – to get full details using a country code.

---

I integrated this API into the React frontend via `fetch` and `axios` calls inside React components.

### Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                   | Solution                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling nested JSON data                   | Used JavaScript optional chaining and map/filter functions        |
| CORS issues when calling API in development | Configured Vite proxy & enabled CORS middleware in backend        |
| JWT token expiration handling               | Implemented token refresh logic + logout on token invalidation    |
| Syncing favorites with MongoDB              | Created protected API routes under `/api/user/favorite.js`        |
| Deployment environment variables            | Used `.env` for local, and Vercel dashboard for production vars   |

###  Reflections

Working with third-party APIs introduced challenges around inconsistent data fields (some countries missing optional properties). I resolved these by implementing defensive coding practices (checking for null/undefined).

Authentication security was ensured with **bcrypt** password hashing and **JWT tokens**. We also faced deployment configuration issues on **Vercel**, especially with environment variables for MongoDB connection, which were resolved by setting these manually in the Vercel dashboard.

---

## Conclusion

The project successfully integrates a REST API with authentication, state management, and a modern frontend build tool (Vite). The solution provides a responsive, user-friendly interface while maintaining backend security best practices.
